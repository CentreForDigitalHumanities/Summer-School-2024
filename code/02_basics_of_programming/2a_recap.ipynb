      "**pandas** is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data\n",
      "structures designed to make working with \"relational\" or \"labeled\" data both\n",
      "easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for\n",
      "doing practical, **real world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has\n",

      "\n",
      "  - Easy handling of missing data in floating point as well as non-floating\n",
      "    point data.\n",
      "  - Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and\n",
      "    higher dimensional objects\n",
      "  - Automatic and explicit data alignment: objects can be explicitly aligned\n",
      "    to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and let\n",
      "    `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. automatically align the data for you in\n",
      "    computations.\n",
      "  - Powerful, flexible group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine\n",
      "    operations on data sets, for both aggregating and transforming data.\n",
      "  - Make it easy to convert ragged, differently-indexed data in other Python\n",
      "    and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects.\n",
      "  - Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large\n",
      "    data sets.\n",
      "  - Intuitive merging and joining data sets.\n",
      "  - Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets.\n",
      "  - Hierarchical labeling of axes (possible to have multiple labels per tick).\n",
      "  - Robust IO tools for loading data from flat files (CSV and delimited),\n",
      "    Excel files, databases, and saving/loading data from the ultrafast HDF5\n",
      "    format.\n",
      "  - Time series-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency\n",
      "    conversion, moving window statistics, date shifting and lagging.\n"
